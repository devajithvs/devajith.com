I am a programmer and an ardent contributor to the open-source community. I started as a Chemical Engineer, I was lucky enough to do my bachelor's in Chemical Engineering from one of the most renowned universities in India (IIT Hyderabad). After my degree, I got placed at Honeywell UOP as a Chemical Engineer, where I learned a lot and met some amazing colleagues.

I used to freelance while working full-time. Freelance work mostly involved full-stack websites and Discord/Telegram bots. I was also contributing to open-source projects. It was initially a learning attempt but I realized that it was what I wanted to do as a career. I took the plunge to switch fields. I am currently doing a Master's in Computing at Cardiff University.

### Some projects I’ve been involved in/contributed to

1. [**postMarketOS**](https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/pmaports/-/merge_requests?scope=all&state=merged&author_username=devajithvs): Contributed to the project postmarketOS that aims at running linux (a fork of alpine linux) natively on smartphones.
2. [**Linux Kernel**](https://www.spinics.net/lists/kernel/msg3770265.html): A patch that adds rudimentary regulator support to kxcjk1013 accelerometer driver. Submitted the patch in an attempt to run mainline linux kernel on a regular smartphone.

### Side projects

I have a lot of unfinished side projects. I will be listing my side-projects here as they finish

1. [**tweeDisc**](https://github.com/devajithvs/tweedisc): A simple discord-twitter integration bot that enables users to Like and Retweet from discord without opening tweet links.
