I've been thinking about this a lot lately. I'll list down the reasons why I chose to write this blog.

## Ideas ideas and ideas

- I sometimes have this Eureka moment where I come up with ideas (sometimes dumb, sometimes great). But if I don't write it down, I forget it the next day. Now that I have a blog, I write all my ideas on a scratchpad. If it's worth exploring, I'll write a blog post and start doing the project.

## Break the silence

- I believed in "Work hard in silence. Let your success (Ferrari) make the noise". The idea is to shock people with your progress by not showing them what you do. That is not a very optimal approach. To succeed, you need to make my noise heard. If you work hard and still fail, at least you've proved that you're capable of building things.

## A note to my future self

- If I look back in 10 years. I have a record of what I did and I can (hopefully) let myself know that pursuing my passion was worth it and that I did not waste my time.

- I keep draft posts as a place to dump my thoughts. Sometimes, it might be worth looking back.

## Improve my language skills

- I am not a good writer (evident from this post), but I am constantly trying to be better and I learn new words every day.
