### Why?

#### Get hired

- I use this blog as a medium to attract great recruiters and companies who would potentially want to hire me.

#### Improve my writing/language skills

- I am not a good writer (evident from this blog), but I am constantly striving to be better. I learn a new word for every visitor this page has. If you see me next time, don't forget to ask me what the word **{{< wordlist >}}** means. This goes into my weekly learning log.

#### A scratchpad for my ideas

- I sometimes have this Eureka moment where I come up with ideas (mostly dumb). But if I don't write it down, I forget it the next day. Now that I have a blog, I write all my ideas on a scratchpad. If it's worth exploring, I'll write a blog post and start doing the project.

#### As a note to my future self

- If I look back in 10 years. I have a record of what I did and I can (hopefully) let myself know that pursuing my passion was worth it and that I did not waste my time.

- I keep draft posts as a place to dump my thoughts. Sometimes, it might be worth looking back.
