### Why?

#### Get hired

- I use this blog as a clever tactic to attract awesome recruiters and companies who might want to hire me. It's like my own personal job-hunting billboard.

#### Improve my writing/language skills

- I'm not the a good writer (yet), but I'm constantly working on it! Every time someone visits my blog, I learn a new word to add to my growing vocabulary. If you see me in person, feel free to quiz me on the meaning of the word **{{< wordlist >}}**. It's part of my weekly learning log!

#### A scratchpad for my ideas

- I'm a genius...or at least I think so in the moment. But if I don't write down my random, sometimes crazy ideas, I'll simply forget them. So now, thanks to my blog, I have a virtual scratchpad where I jot down all my Eureka moments. Who knows, one of them might just turn into a big thing!

#### As a note to my future self

- 10 years from now, and I'm reminiscing about my journey. Thanks to my blog, I'll have a record of all the crazy things I did, the lessons I learned, and the adventures. It's like a time capsule that will remind me why I pursued my passions and didn't waste my time binge-watching Youtube (maybe just a little).

So, there you have it! My blog is more than just a collection of posts, it's my online playground where I can showcase my skills, dump my thoughts, and leave a trail of hilarious stories for my future self. Plus, it's a great way to procrastinate when I should be doing something else.
