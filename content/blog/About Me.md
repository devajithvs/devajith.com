I started off as a Chemical Engineer, braving the infamous JEE exams and earning my stripes at an "IIT" in India. I even landed a job at Honeywell UOP, doing the whole chemical engineering thing. But little did I know that destiny had a different plan in store for me!

I couldn't resist the siren call of programming. So, while slinging chemical equations by day, I started freelancing as a full-stack developer on the side. And guess what? It was love at first code! I took the plunge and waved goodbye to chemical plants and heat exchangers, and pursued a Master's in Computing at Cardiff University.

It didn't stop there, I've had some seriously cool side projects along the way. I've built a Discord-Twitter integration bot called tweeDisc in just a day or two, and it has earned a whopping $5672 in gross revenue as of today! with a little help from some luck and my friend's awesome sales skills.

I also engaged in other side projects like running the mainline Linux kernel on my Android device, where I ran Linux natively on my smartphone. And to top it off, I even submitted a patch upstream to the Linux Kernel, adding regulator support to an accelerometer driver.

If you're curious to know what coding escapades I'm up to now, check out my website for the latest projects.

### Current life and low-key boasting
I'm currently slaying it as a Compiler Engineer Intern at Huawei UK, where I'm using MLIR and with my awesome colleagues to optimize performance and make BLAS routines **FLY**. I've even upstreamed patches to the LLVM Project as a part of this.

But wait, there's more! I'm not just a tech whiz, I was also a competitive swimmer before my days at IIT Hyderabad. So, you can count on my determination and drive to excel in whatever I do.

I'm also a self-proclaimed quick learner and team player, and the last time I updated this post, I was preparing for a talk at the EuroLLVM 2023 on my latest project, mlir-query. Can't wait to share more about it!

But hey, if you're looking for a more "formal" view (or better yet, want to hire me), feel free to peek at my [resume](resume). Cheers!
