A scratchpad for my ideas I sometimes have this Eureka moment where I come up with ideas (mostly dumb). But if I don\u0026rsquo;t write it down, I forget it the next day. Now that I have a blog, I write all my ideas on a scratchpad. If it\u0026rsquo;s worth exploring, I\u0026rsquo;ll write a blog post and start doing the project. As a note to my future self If I look back in 10 years. I have a record of what I did and I can (hopefully) let myself know that pursuing my passion was worth it and that I did not waste my time.\nI keep draft posts as a place to dump my thoughts. Sometimes, it might be worth looking back.\n","permalink":"https://devajith.com/blog/why-do-i-have-a-blog/","summary":"Why?

Tweedisc is an application that allows people to post tweet links on their community discord servers and like, share or retweet each other\u0026rsquo;s Twitter posts without leaving Discord.\nUsecase and Target Audience Tweedisc turned out to be a handy tool for people, businesses, projects, and pretty much everyone else that has a community on Discord. The tool helps discord communities engage with stuff happening on Twitter and also boosts engagement for small communities by interacting with each other. The linking process only takes a few clicks. This tool saves time for users of having to log in or switch accounts just to Retweet/Like a Tweet.\nProfits and Expenses My friend helped me ship the product to the target audience. In 10 days, we had 20 people signed up. It runs on a spare google cloud server that I have (basically free, google has an \u0026ldquo;always free\u0026rdquo; VPS instance that I use to run small applications).\nCurrently (as of 26th Jan 2022), the project has one paying customer (5$/month) and 51 users. The cost to run the server is zero, making the net revenue 5$.\nDevelopment Sprint The working prototype was built in 2 days (new year sprint). This was my development process:\nI jumped straight into the API Documentations for Twitter and Discord to see if the project is viable.\nStarted coding a Discord bot using the python library - discordpy. The bot will react to Twitter links with a like and retweet reaction. Whenever a user reacts to the message, the bot gets notified.\nSigned up for a Twitter developer account to access the Twitter API. API is rate limited but more than enough for an initial prototype.\nImplemented a linking system linking a user\u0026rsquo;s Twitter account with their Discord utilizing Oauth2 authentication for Discord and Twitter.\nThe bot makes a request to the Twitter API on behalf of the user with the corresponding reaction whenever a user reacts to a Twitter link.\nIf the user is not registered, the bot deletes the reaction and message the user with a URL to link their Discord account.\nOther Contributions While building the prototype, the python API library for Twitter - \u0026ldquo;Tweepy\u0026rdquo; had a feature missing for which I made a pull request, but it did not get merged as the maintainer eventually pushed an update as there were some changes that the maintainer needed to do.\nOauth2 I spent some time with Oauth2. I learned how authentication works and enjoyed implementing the system.\nReflection I learned that if you code and you love to do it. You can build amazing things that people use. That is a joy.\n","permalink":"https://devajith.com/blog/tweedisc/","summary":"What is Tweedisc?

But currently, I am a broke university student who cannot afford a piano or a guitar. On the bright side, I love coding and have a computer with a keyboard.\nThe idea struck me and ergo I did an analysis, mostly on pianos. A classical piano has 88 keys. A regular computer keyboard (US) has 101 keys. It is possible to do a one-to-one mapping of the keys. But some laptop keyboards have fewer keys. Also, we must refrain from using some function keys as it might wreck the computer settings.\nWhat is a way to play piano with fewer keyboard keys? Let\u0026rsquo;s assume that we only have the character keys (26), numbers (10), and special keys (10) at our disposal. The good thing about a computer keyboard is that we can use combinations instead of just having one key typed at a time. We can cover the entire keyboard with precisely 44 characters by taking other keys like Shift for combinations.\nLimitations There\u0026rsquo;s a catch though. A musician might need two tones played concurrently, which is difficult if it is not a one-to-one mapping. For instance, it will be impossible to play the tones corresponding to the characters c and Shift + c simultaneously.\nThe best solution for this problem is to have the shorter black keys (sharps) have Shift + character combination as it\u0026rsquo;s less used than other Normal flat tones. Upon further googling, I figured that a chord with both flats and sharps is uncommon and thus acceptable for our use case.\nImplementation ideas The current plan is to make software that would run anywhere. I would love to do it in the programming language Rust. But, I am not sure how portable I can make it. So, I might consider making a web app with web assembly.\nI have plans to gamify this. I borrowed the idea from a popular app/game called \u0026ldquo;Piano tiles\u0026rdquo;. There are black tiles that come pouring down the screen. All you have to do is tap when it is the right time and it plays sweet tones.\n\u0026ldquo;Piano Tiles\u0026rdquo; is an exceptional idea for an app. It is possible to blend some of that into this project; analyzing popular songs, ordering them based on difficulty, and then gamifying them. Unlike \u0026ldquo;Piano Tiles\u0026rdquo; the cool thing is that a person can play \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; music on this app instead of just wasting time playing.\nIf I move along with this idea, I plan to release it under an open-source license.\nI hope I will find enough time to complete this project despite all the placement, assignments, and part-time workload.\n","permalink":"https://devajith.com/blog/pc-keyboard-as-a-piano/","summary":"Interesting idea, but this is still a work in progress.\nMotivation I love singing and playing instruments.

After my degree, I got placed at Honeywell UOP as a Chemical Engineer, where I learned a lot and met some amazing colleagues.\nI used to freelance while working full-time. Freelance work mostly involved full-stack websites and Discord/Telegram bots. I was also contributing to open-source projects. It was initially a learning attempt but I realized that it was what I wanted to do as a career. I took the plunge to switch fields. I am currently doing a Master\u0026rsquo;s in Computing at Cardiff University.\nSome projects I’ve been involved in/contributed to postMarketOS: Contributed to the project postmarketOS that aims at running linux (a fork of alpine linux) natively on smartphones. Linux Kernel: A patch that adds rudimentary regulator support to kxcjk1013 accelerometer driver. Submitted the patch in an attempt to run mainline linux kernel on a regular smartphone. Side projects I have a lot of unfinished side projects.
