[{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;m a programmer and a fan of the open-source community. I started my journey as a Chemical Engineer and aced my bachelor\u0026rsquo;s degree from the prestigious IIT Hyderabad in India (yeah, I survived those notorious exams!). But then, after landing a job at Honeywell UOP as a Chemical Engineer and freelancing as a full-stack developer on the side, I realized that coding was my true calling. So, I took the plunge and switched fields to pursue a Master\u0026rsquo;s in Computing at Cardiff University.\nSome projects Iâ€™ve been involved in/contributed to And oh, most exiting part, my side projects. I\u0026rsquo;ve built a sweet Discord-Twitter integration bot called tweeDisc in just a day or two, and guess what? It has earned a whopping $5672 in gross revenue as of today! But I must admit, it was partly due to some luck and the sales skills of my awesome friend.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve also engaged in some other cool side projects like running the mainline Linux kernel on my Android device, where I ran Linux natively on my smartphone. Yes, you heard that right! I even submitted a patch upstream to the Linux Kernel to add regulator support to an accelerometer driver.\nYou can check here for the latest projects I\u0026rsquo;m working on.\nCurrent life and low-key boasting I\u0026rsquo;m currently slaying it as a Compiler Engineer intern at Huawei Technologies, where I\u0026rsquo;m using MLIR with some awesome colleagues to optimize performance and make BLAS routines fly. I\u0026rsquo;ve even upstreamed patches to the LLVM Project as a part of this.\nBut wait, there\u0026rsquo;s more! I\u0026rsquo;m not just a tech whiz, I was also a competitive swimmer before my days at IIT Hyderabad. So, you can count on my determination and drive to excel in whatever I do.\nI\u0026rsquo;m also a self-proclaimed quick learner and team player, and the last time I updated this post, I was preparing for a talk at the EuroLLVM 2023 on my latest project, mlir-query. Can\u0026rsquo;t wait to share more about it!\nResume But hey, if you\u0026rsquo;re looking for a more \u0026ldquo;formal\u0026rdquo; view (or better yet, want to hire me), feel free to peek at my resume.

Tweedisc is a one-of-a-kind application that revolutionizes the way people engage with Twitter on Discord. It allows users to effortlessly post tweet links on their community Discord servers, and like, share, or retweet each other\u0026rsquo;s tweets without ever leaving Discord.\nUsecase and Target Audience Tweedisc has quickly become an indispensable tool for a wide range of users, including individuals, businesses, projects, and communities on Discord. It simplifies the process of interacting with tweets on Twitter and boosts engagement for small communities by facilitating interactions within Discord. With just a few clicks, users can easily link their Twitter accounts and start liking, sharing, and retweeting tweets, saving time and effort.\nProfits and Expenses My friend helped me ship the product to the target audience. In 10 days, we had 20 people signed up. It runs on a spare google cloud server that I have (basically free, google has an \u0026ldquo;always free\u0026rdquo; VPS instance that I use to run small applications).\nCurrently (as of 26th Jan 2022), the project has one paying customer (5$/month) and 51 users. The cost to run the server is zero, making the net revenue 5$.\nUPDATE: Tweedisc started gaining traction quickly, and within a few months, it reached a milestone of $400 in Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR). This was a significant achievement for me, it proved that I can make money online and work for myself. With a lot of paying users, Tweedisc was able to generate decent revenue.\nUPDATE2: Despite the initial success, Tweedisc faced a setback when Twitter stopped providing API access. This decision affected the functionality of the tool, as it heavily relied on the Twitter API to interact with tweets. As a result, the project had to be discontinued, and the revenue generation came to a halt.\nDevelopment Sprint The journey of Tweedisc started with an ambitious development sprint that spanned just two days during the New Year. Here\u0026rsquo;s a brief overview of the development process:\nExtensive research and understanding of the API documentations for Twitter and Discord to determine the project\u0026rsquo;s feasibility.\nCoding of a Discord bot using the powerful Python library, discordpy. The bot is designed to react to Twitter links with like and retweet reactions, with notifications sent to the bot whenever a user reacts to a tweet.\nSigning up for a Twitter developer account to gain access to the Twitter API, which is rate-limited but more than sufficient for a prototype.\nImplementation of a seamless linking system that connects a user\u0026rsquo;s Twitter account with their Discord account using OAuth2 authentication for both Discord and Twitter.\nIntegration of the bot with the Twitter API, allowing it to make requests on behalf of users and perform corresponding reactions to tweets whenever a user reacts to a tweet on Discord.\nCreation of a user-friendly system that prompts unregistered users to link their Discord account with a URL, and deletes reactions and sends messages accordingly.\nOther Contributions In addition to the successful development of Tweedisc, I also made significant contributions to the Python API library for Twitter, called \u0026ldquo;Tweepy.\u0026rdquo; I submitted a pull request to address a missing feature, although it did not get merged as the maintainer had already pushed an update. Nevertheless, this experience allowed me to further enhance my coding skills and gain valuable insights into open-source collaboration.\nOauth2 The implementation of OAuth2 for Tweedisc was a challenging yet rewarding experience. It provided me with a deep understanding of how authentication works and allowed me to hone my technical skills in this area.\nReflection Tweedisc was a successful project that earned $5672 in revenue to date and had a significant number of paying users. However, due to Twitter\u0026rsquo;s decision to stop providing API access (made it very expensive), the project had to be discontinued. Tweedisc was my first successful startup.\n","permalink":"https://devajith.com/blog/tweedisc/","summary":"What is Tweedisc?

But fear not! I\u0026rsquo;ve got a computer with a keyboard, and I\u0026rsquo;m a coding enthusiast.\nSo I thought, why not combine my love for music and coding? And thus, the idea was born to play piano with a computer keyboard! But of course, it\u0026rsquo;s still a work in progress, so bear with me here.\nNow, I did some serious analysis, mostly on pianos. Did you know a classical piano has 88 keys, but a regular computer keyboard has 101 keys? Talk about a close match! But wait, some laptop keyboards have fewer keys, and we can\u0026rsquo;t mess with those function keys, or we risk wrecking our computer settings.\nWhat is a way to play piano with fewer keyboard keys? So, what\u0026rsquo;s the solution? Well, we\u0026rsquo;ve got 26 character keys, 10 numbers, and 10 special keys to work with. And the cool thing about computer keyboards is that we can use combinations, like using Shift for added options. With some clever mapping, we can cover the entire piano keyboard with just 44 characters!\nLimitations But of course, there\u0026rsquo;s a catch. Musicians often need to play two tones concurrently, which can get tricky with non-one-to-one mapping. Like, try playing c and Shift + c at the same time, it\u0026rsquo;s like rubbing your belly and patting your head at the same time!\nBut fret not, I\u0026rsquo;ve got a plan! I\u0026rsquo;ll assign the shorter black keys (sharps) to Shift + character combinations, since they\u0026rsquo;re less commonly used. And after some thorough Googling, turns out a chord with both flats and sharps is pretty uncommon, so it\u0026rsquo;s all good for our use case!\nImplementation ideas Now, onto the implementation ideas. I\u0026rsquo;m thinking of making this software run anywhere, and I\u0026rsquo;ve got a soft spot for the Rust programming language. But hey, I\u0026rsquo;m not sure how portable that\u0026rsquo;ll be, so I might consider making a web app with web assembly.\nOh, and here\u0026rsquo;s the best part! I\u0026rsquo;ve got plans to gamify this whole thing, taking inspiration from a popular app/game called \u0026ldquo;Piano Tiles\u0026rdquo;. Imagine black tiles pouring down the screen, and you gotta tap them at the right time to play sweet tunes! ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ® But unlike \u0026ldquo;Piano Tiles\u0026rdquo;, you\u0026rsquo;ll be playing real music, not just wasting time! ðŸŽµ\nIf I move along with this idea, I plan to release it under an open-source license.\nOf course, with all the university placements, assignments, and part-time work, time might be a challenge, but hey, where there\u0026rsquo;s a will, there\u0026rsquo;s a way!\nUpdate Good news (or bad?), everyone! I\u0026rsquo;ve been able to save up some money thanks to my internship as a compiler engineer, and I finally bought a real piano! So, I might have to scrap my \u0026ldquo;keyboard piano\u0026rdquo; project after all. Turns out, playing on an actual piano is a whole different ballgame. But hey, at least I won\u0026rsquo;t be limited to just 44 keys anymore! Can\u0026rsquo;t wait to unleash my musical talents on those real piano keys. Who knows, maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll even learn to play a chord with both flats and sharps - take that, limitations! Cheers to chasing dreams.\n","permalink":"https://devajith.com/blog/pc-keyboard-as-a-piano/","summary":"Interesting idea, but this is still a work in progress.\nMotivation So, picture this: I\u0026rsquo;m a broke university student who loves singing and playing instruments, but can\u0026rsquo;t afford a piano or a guitar.
